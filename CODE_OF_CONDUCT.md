# EcoHabit Code of Conduct

The EcoHabit project is dedicated to providing an inclusive and welcoming environment for all members and contributors. We are committed to fostering a diverse and respectful community that appreciates and celebrates the unique contributions of each individual.

To support this goal, we have established this code of conduct as a guideline for all members and contributors of the EcoHabit community.

1. Be respectful and considerate of others. We encourage open and honest dialogue, but we expect all members and contributors to be respectful and professional in their interactions with others.

2. Be inclusive. We welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives to participate in the EcoHabit community. We strive to create an environment that is inclusive and welcoming to everyone.

3. Be mindful of your language and behavior. We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination of any kind, including but not limited to harassment based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, or ability.

4. Be open and transparent. We believe in transparency and open communication. We encourage members and contributors to be transparent in their actions and decisions, and to communicate openly and honestly with others in the community.

5. Be collaborative. We value collaboration and teamwork. We encourage members and contributors to work together to solve problems and achieve common goals.

By participating in the EcoHabit community, you agree to uphold this code of conduct. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to contact the EcoHabit team. We are here to support and help create a positive and inclusive community.
